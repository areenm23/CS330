Q1. In testcase1.c, how many times the swapper process got scheduled?
	10 times swapper process was  scheduled in testcase.

Q2. In testcase3.c, how many times the swapper process is scheduled and why?
	
	process 1 has been sleep for 10 sec then process 2, 3, 4 will take the cpu. but from info 2,3, 4 has completed early than 10sec
	so swapper must take until process 1 comes back to ready state. Number of time swapper schedules It completely depends on
	execution time of process 2, 3, 4.	


Q3. In testcase5.c, how many times the sum value was less than 10 and why?    

	sum is less than 10,  22 times it 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 10 for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1 respectively.

Part 2
------

Q1. In testcase1.c, in which level the page table entries for the two addresses
for which walk_pt is called diverse and why?

	Level 3 page entry is diverse because difference between vitual addresses is high.	




Q2. In testcase2.c, reason about the page table entries at different levels for 
(ptr+4096) across different invocation of walk_pt. Specifically, differentiate
the entries w.r.t. the entries corresponding to (ptr)






Q3. Explain the gemOS physical memory allocation logic for the user stack
    region by examining the o/p of testcase4.c.



Q4. In testcase5.c, the PFN used to maintain L4 page table for the two addresses
    are same. (True/False) with justification.


	No they are not same.

	

Q5. Which bit is used to maintain the `write' permission for a page? Justify. 

	write bit 3 Lowest significant bit. 
	in first testcase accessflags are like 1B, 1B, 1B, 11 it means 1011 -- 1001 write bit for pages tables should be or write bit of next page
	tables so from the testcase it means 3LSB is only possible.
